Contains code for listening to the knock/sound emitter.

Simple setup using the DAC on an UNO to detect sound levels:

The plan is to set this up to knock and then listen. Record loudest x readings per knock(based on sample rate), average them, and pipe the data to a method in Localization. Localization will keep track of each time it recieves data and whichever it has more of (hollow or solid values) will determine what that square will be.
